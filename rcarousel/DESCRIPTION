Description: 
    The 'rcarousel' package provides a customizable, responsive carousel component 
    for Shiny applications. It allows you to efficiently display and transition 
    through multiple UI modules (such as charts, tables, or images) in a track-based 
    slider interface. The carousel supports both circle (dot) indicators and 
    square button indicators with labels, making it easy to navigate between 
    different modules. Users can also customize the colors of navigation arrows 
    and indicator states, and adjust the carousel container height to ensure a 
    clean layout in their apps. 
    Use four spaces when indenting paragraphs within the Description.
